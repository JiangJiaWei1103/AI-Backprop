# AI Backprop
I summarize research papers and implement AI algorithms, with all tutorials and experiments hosted on Kaggle for clarity. I also take fundamental courses to deepen my understanding of AI theory, which will be shared if I'm free.

If you're interested in any demo, please feel free to open an issue and I will add it to my list.
